Cloud-Based Secure File Sharing This project is a temporary, secure file-sharing web application built using Flask, JavaScript, and QR codes. Users can upload files, generate password-protected shareable links, and access them via QR codes. To enhance security, files automatically expire and delete after a set duration.
